Aim: 

Time series forcasting for energy consumpttion:optimizing resource allocation in smart grid systems.

Objectives :

development of an accurate time series forcasting model for energy consumption.
optimization of energy distribution and resource allocation in smart grid systems.
reduction in operational costs and improve grid reliability.
enhanced sustainability through efficient energy management practices.


 using python libraries like numpy,panda,matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn etc we started analysing the data set.with the help of [pandas we read the data set in jupyter notebook.
data preprocessing is done at first.there was no missing valure or duplicate values in that data set.we analyse relation ship with various features throgh numerical,tabular and visual methods.
feature engineerimng is done by transforming existing features and encoding categorical variables.
feature scaling/normalization is done using standard scaler and min max scaler.
data splitting is done in 80-20 split.
ml models like linear regression,decision tree,random forest regressor,svm models are used for model building.there are time series model like arima,sarima and exponential smoothing
.implementation of these models can make result more accurate.
by evaluating the model using MSE,RMSE,MAE it is found that linear regression and svm are more accurate models.
regression plot shows that energy consumption has not much relationship with the features [provided in this data set.
so with the help of this model further studies is required to analyse more features that has close relationship with energy consumption
and with proper allocation of these resources we could attain sustainable energy consumption.
